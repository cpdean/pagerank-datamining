<div class="text"><p><strong>Post-doctoral Fellowship in Social Computing and Crowd Sourcing</strong></p>
<p><strong>Carnegie Mellon University</strong></p>
<p>The Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University is recruiting a post-doctoral fellow in psychology, computer science or related disciplines to support a new research project on large scale distributed collaboration and crowd sourcing. &nbsp;Crowd sourcing marketplaces like Amazon’s Mechanical Turk have been mainly been used for accomplishing small, well defined nuggets of work, such as labeling images and transcribing audio, but are rarely used for more complex and integrated task, such as writing a complex document or program, typical of real world tasks in organizations. We are developing a framework and software infrastructure to better integrate the work of dozens of individuals to product produce complex artifacts together. Our research combines empirical research on the best strategies to combine the efforts of individual workers and software development to accomplish this integration.</p>
<p>An ideal post-doctoral fellow will have interests and skills blending social psychology or organizational behavior with computer science and implementation. The candidate must have a PhD in computer science, HCI, information science, social psychology, organizational behavior, communication or a related discipline. The post-doctoral fellow would be supervised by Niki Kittur and Robert Kraut.</p>
<p>The post-doctoral fellow will be part of a broader research group on social computing. There will be opportunities to take courses at Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh that support advanced research skills (e.g., organizational behavior, social psychology, specialized statistics, research methodology classes, machine learning, small groups). The fellowship is for two years with the possibility of renewal.</p>
<p>Interested candidates should send a personal statement describing career<br />
objectives, background and experience along with a CV in Word or pdf<br />
format to nkittur@cs.cmu.edu.&nbsp; Have at least two references also directly send their letters to this address, with your name in the subject line. Questions about the position should be addressed to Niki Kittur &lt;nkittur@cs.cmu.edu</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Ph.D. Summer Internship in Crowd Sourcing Research</strong></p>
<p><strong>Carnegie Mellon University</strong></p>
<p>We are looking for summer interns to work on next-generation crowdsourcing and collaboration technologies in the Social Computing Lab in Carnegie Mellon’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute. Our department works on a variety of projects that understand and build tools to support online collaboration, combining ideas and technologies from cloud computing, social networking, incentive design, organizational management and information visualization.</p>
<p>Crowd sourcing marketplaces like Amazon’s Mechanical Turk have been mainly been used for accomplishing small, well defined nuggets of work, such as labeling images and transcribing audio, but are rarely used for more complex and integrated task, such as writing &nbsp;a complex document or program, typical of real world tasks in organizations. &nbsp;We are developing a framework and software infrastructure to better integrate the work of dozens of individuals to product produce complex artifacts together. &nbsp;Our research combines empirical research on the best strategies to combine the efforts of individual workers and software development to accomplish this integration.</p>
<p>You will be involved in building tools and running experiments on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk investigating the optimal ways for individuals to collaborate online to produce complex artifacts together, such as writing articles or software. &nbsp;The work will include building an interface and backend to run experiments on Mechanical Turk, collecting and analyzing data, and writing up the results. &nbsp;Your efforts could have immediate impacts both in academia and in the real-world, resulting in publications in top HCI conferences as well as potentially changing the future of work.</p>
<p>=== Requirements ===</p>
<p>Candidates should have the necessary skills to perform research and build systems and must be able to generate new ideas, develop novel conceptual models and architectures and validate them with working prototypes and experiments. &nbsp;Candidates must be enrolled in a PhD program in computer science, human-computer interaction, organizational behavior or a related field. Candidates must also have strong programming skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; * Experience and interest in online group collaboration, production, or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; coordination<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; * Proficiency in Python/Ruby, SQL, Java, and Web programming (e.g., PHP)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; * User interface programming and design skills highly desired</p>
<p>Starting and ending dates are flexible, but the preferred dates are June, July and August of 2011 in Pittsburgh PA. The internship will provide $3,200 in monthly stipend.</p>
<p>Interested candidates should send a personal statement describing career objectives, background and experience along with a CV in Word or pdf format to nkittur@cs.cmu.edu.&nbsp; Have at least two references also directly send their letters to this address, with your name in the subject line. Questions about the position should be addressed to Niki Kittur &lt;nkittur@cs.cmu.edu.</p>
