<h3 class="postTitle">Spring Term Course Descriptions</h3>
<div class="date">February 11, 2011</div>
<div class="text"><p><strong>CS 201: Data Structures. Instructor: Sherri Goings, Time: 4a</strong><br />
Prerequisite: CS 111 or consent of the instructor.</p>
<p>Think back to your favorite assignment from Intro to Computer Science. Did you ever get the feeling that "there has to be a better/smarter way to do this problem?" The Data Structures course is all about how to store information intelligently and access it efficiently. How can Google take your query, compare it to billions of web pages, and return the answer in less than one second?&nbsp; How can one store information so as to balance the competing needs for fast data retrieval and fast data modification?&nbsp; To help us answer questions like these, we will analyze and implement stacks, queues, trees, linked lists, graphs and hash tables.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CS 204: Software Design. Instructor: Amy Csizmar Dalal, Time:&nbsp; 5a</strong><br />
Prerequisite: CS 111 or consent of the instructor.</p>
<p>Most software is developed by programmers with the best of intentions: I will study the needs of my audience, I will design before coding, I will write thorough and useful documentation, I will test exhaustively, and I will keep good records. Unfortunately, good intentions don't guarantee much. This course will focus on techniques and tools that will help you create good software and follow through on those good intentions. The course will center around a few medium-sized projects, with an emphasis on the formation of good habits in design, implementation, testing, and documentation. (Though there are many important things to be said about software engineering in teams, this course will not emphasize these issues, and you will be free to work individually or in groups.) Topics we will consider include code construction, object-oriented design, design patterns, requirements and specifications, testing, user interface design, and various programming tools (debuggers, integrated development environments, version control systems, etc.). We will also read lots of great advice from some leading writers on programming, and we will welcome a few professional programmers to class for story-telling and interrogation.</p>
<p><strong>CS 254: Automata &amp; Computability. Instructor: Jeff Ondich, Time: 1a</strong><br />
(a.k.a. What Your Computer Can and Cannot Do)<br />
Prerequisites: CS 111 and (CS 202 or Math 236).</p>
<p>An introduction to the theory of computation. We'll talk about what problems you can and can't solve with a computer that has a finite amount of memory; problems that you'd love to write a program to solve, but you can't (because there just aren't enough programs to go around); and self-reference and all the trouble it can cause. Partially computational, partially mathematical, and partially philosophical.</p>
<p><strong>CS 311 : Computer Graphics. Instructor: Jack Goldfeather, Time: 4a</strong><br />
Prerequisites: CS 201 and Math 232, or consent of the instructor.</p>
<p>An image on a typical computer screen is made up of tiny dots (or pixels) each of which can be set to a particular color chosen from a predetermined palette. How do you start from this simple concept and develop the tools to create startingly real-looking computer generated effects seen in films like The Lord of the Rings? Take this course and find out! You will write your own programs for drawing and manipulating two- and three-dimensional images and learn about such graphics concepts as wire-frame drawing, 2D and 3D geometric transformations, perspective projection, hidden surface removal, lighting models, fractal and spline surfaces, raytracing, texture mapping, and more.</p>
<p>You will have the choice of programming in Python, Java or C++. If you only know Python and are interested in learning Java or C++ this is a good course in which to do it. A number of web-based tutorials are available for helping programmers experienced in one language to learn other languages quickly.</p>
<p>If you don't have the linear algebra prerequisite but are familiar with the basic concepts of matrix multiplication and its use in transforming vectors in 2, 3 and 4-space, and with tangent planes, normal vectors and dot product from calculus III, you will be able to take this course.</p>
<p><strong>CS 324: Data Mining. Dave Musicant, 3a</strong><br />
Prerequisite: CS 201 or consent of instructor.</p>
<p>How does Google always understand what it is you're looking for? How does Amazon.com figure out what items you might be interested in buying? How can categories of similar politicians be identified, based on their voting patterns? These questions and others are part of machine learning and data mining, two highly related fields of study at the crossroads of artificial intelligence, database systems, and statistics. Machine learning concerns itself with the goal of getting a computer to learn or discover patterns, whereas data mining focuses this task on learning or finding patterns in large databases. We'll focus on techniques such as classification, clustering, association rules, web mining, collaborative filtering, and others.</p>
<p><strong>CS 352:&nbsp; Advanced Algorithms.&nbsp; David Liben-Nowell, 2-3c</strong><br />
Prerequisite:&nbsp; CS 252 or consent of instructor.</p>
<p>If you enjoyed designing and analyzing algorithms in CS 252, here's your chance to do more! &nbsp;In Advanced Algorithms, we'll spend the term on a variety of algorithmic design techniques. &nbsp;A sampling of potential topics: approximation algorithms (can we efficiently compute near-optimal solutions even when finding exact solutions is computationally intractable?); randomized algorithms (does flipping coins help in designing faster/simpler algorithms?); and online algorithms (how do we analyze an algorithm that needs to make decisions before the entire input arrives?). &nbsp;We will sprinkle in some computational complexity and maybe some advanced data structures as appropriate. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The precise structure of the class will depend on class size and your preferences, but we'll do something like a Top Ten(ish) list of my Favorite Classical Algorithms, intermixed with reading and discussing some recently published algorithmic papers.</p></div>
