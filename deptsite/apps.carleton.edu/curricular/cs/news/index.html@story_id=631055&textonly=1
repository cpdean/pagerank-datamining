<h3 class="postTitle">Job Opportunity with Mobiata</h3>
<div class="date">May 6, 2010</div>
<div class="text"><p>Email message from Ben Kazez '07:</p>
<p>I'm excited to say that Mobiata is again hiring! We actually have three job descriptions to post, which are all below. The contact is jobs@mobiata.com</p>
<p><strong>Mobile App Engineer (iPhone, Android, ...)</strong></p>
<p>We are a small, profitable start-up company with some of the most successful travel apps for iPhone, Android and BlackBerry. We're expanding rapidly in both products and platforms, which is why we need people to help us maintain and grow our successful apps. If you are a star developer who can tackle tough problems, write pristine code, obsess over our apps — and have fun doing all of it, we want to talk to you.</p>
<p>A little bit about us: Mobiata creates best-selling mobile travel applications that have been featured by the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Boston Globe, Forbes, Washington Post, TechCrunch, USA Today, Macworld, PC Magazine and in Apple TV and print ads. In addition to our consumer apps, we're working with travel companies to be their solution for mobile product development and execution. We are a mixture of super-smart young developers and a few veteran mobile executives. This means we're fast, wise and able to get things done. We like being the best and we think you do, too.</p>
<p>Interested? Here's why we think you should want to work for Mobiata.</p>
<p>- You'll work on projects from initial design to release.<br />
- You will use the best technology for each project<br />
- Since we have a huge user base, you will work on products that reach hundreds of thousands of users.<br />
- Your ideas will be heard and very likely implemented.</p>
<p>You should have:<br />
- Experience using &lt;insert technology group&gt;<br />
- A very strong sense of self motivation<br />
- Passion about good user experience<br />
- Rock-solid programming skills<br />

– iPhone, Android, BlackBerry.</p>
<p><strong>QA/Testing Engineer</strong></p>

We're expanding rapidly in both products and platforms, which is why we need people to help us maintain and grow our successful apps. If you are a star QA/testing engineer who can tackle tough problems, find lots of bugs, obsess over our apps — and have fun doing all of it, we want to talk to you. You’ll find trouble problems, analyze performance, and execute creative tests to find new bugs. You’ll derive a holistic<br />
understanding of our products from the code level to delivery, and will be called on to suggest and design new features and products to fill our users’ needs.</p>
